        <p>Hello! My name is Erik. I really don't like to talk about myself, but I suppose this is the place to do it. I'm changing every day, so I will be a different person by the time you read this versus when I wrote this. I guess I can get into what I've been into lately and what I've been into my whole life.</p>

        <p>Here they come! They're coming in too fast! Oooh! We've lost lateral controls. Don't worry, she'll hold together. You hear me, baby? Hold together! Got him! I got him! Great kid! Don't get cocky. There are still two more of them out there! That's it! We did it! We did it! Help! I think I'm melting! This is all your fault.</p>

        <p>Stand by, Chewie, here we go. Cut in the sublight engines. What the...? Aw, we've come out of hyperspace into a meteor shower. Some kind of asteroid collision. It's not on any of the charts. What's going on? Our position is correct, except...no, Alderaan! What do you mean? Where is it? Thats what I'm trying to tell you, kid. It ain't there. It's been totally blown away. What? How? Destroyed...by the Empire!</p>
